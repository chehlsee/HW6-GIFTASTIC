### Description

In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

This app is made of an array of string, each one relating to the topic of Tim Burton. The app will take in the topics in the array and will create buttons on the HTML. When the user submits what they have typed in the search box the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. When the user clicks on the still GIPHY images the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif a second time it will stop playing. Each gif is displayed with a rating (PG, G, R, and so on) this data has been provided by the GIPHY API. 

* The form on the page takes the value from a user input box and will add it to the `topics` array on the top of the page and render a button on the page for the user topic.
